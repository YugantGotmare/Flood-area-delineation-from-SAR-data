# Flood area delineation from SAR data

## Aim
The aim is to develop a DL/ML model to accurately map flooded areas using SAR imagery, which remains effective during flood seasons when clouds obscure optical data. This model will enhance early warning systems and disaster response.

## Objective
The objective is to collect SAR imagery data for flood-prone regions, clean and preprocess this data for analysis, and develop a DL/ML model to identify and delineate flooded areas. The model will be validated using ground truth data and other reliable sources. Once validated, the model will be integrated into a system for real-time flood monitoring and response. Continuous evaluation and refinement of the model will be conducted to enhance its accuracy and reliability.
